# Skilled: E-Learning Landing Page

## My Process
1. Explored Figma mockup and creating the project structure.
2. Imported Google Font, defined resets in CSS and set up CSS variables for font family and weight, border radius values, and colors.
3. Build mobile version.
4. Build desktop version.
5. Deployed to Netlify.

### Built With
HTML and CSS

### What I Learned
- Explored CSS Block Element Modifier naming, solidified responsive design and mobile-first approach knowledge and identified areas for improvement.
- Worked with a Figma mockup provided by Frontend Mentor, bringing the interface to life. Embraced a mobile-first approach and honed responsive design skills using relative units, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- Encountered a fascinating bug that led me to delve into the z-index property in CSS. Hover effects on one of three buttons weren't working due to an absolutely positioned image overlapping the button‚Äîa valuable lesson in troubleshooting!
- Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow. The journey from design to launch was filled with lessons, and I'm eager to refine my skills further.


### Time Commitment
Tracked my progress and completed the project in 7 hours, including all final touch ups. Proof that learning and creating can be efficient and enjoyable!
